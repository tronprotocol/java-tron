# Contributing to java-tron

java-tron is an open source project.

It is the work of contributors. We appreciate your help!

Here are instructions to get you started. They are not perfect, so
please let us know if anything feels wrong or incomplete.

## Contribution guidelines

### Pull requests

First of all, java-tron follows [gitflow workflow](
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
Please open pull requests to the **develop** branch. Once approved,
we will close the pull request and merge into master branch.

We are always happy to receive pull requests, and do our best to
review them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull
request? Do it! We would appreciate it.

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be
discouraged as it can be a possible oversight. Please explain your code as
detailed as possible to make it easier for us to understand.

### Create issues

Any significant improvement should be documented as [a GitHub
issue](https://github.com/tronprotocol/java-tron/issues) before anyone
starts working on it.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these three questions:

- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

### Please check existing issues and docs first!

Please take a moment to check that your bug report or improvement proposal
doesn't already exist. If it does, please add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too".
This will help prioritize the most common problems and requests.
